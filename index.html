					What is Computer?
				</header>
				<p>
					A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences
                     of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically.
                      Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of 
                      operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to
                       perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally
                       
                       complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system 
                       (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation.
                        This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together,
                         such as a computer network or computer cluster.

				<p>A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems.
                     Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included,
                      as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design,
                     as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.

				Generation of computer.
				</header>
				<p>
					The modern computer took its shape with the arrival of your time. 
                    It had been around 16th century when the evolution of the computer started. 
                    The initial computer faced many changes, obviously for the betterment.
                     It continuously improved itself in terms of speed, accuracy, size, 
                     and price to urge the form of the fashionable day computer.
                      This long period is often conveniently divided into the subsequent phases 
                      called computer generations:

First Generation Computers (1940-1956)
Second Generation Computers (1956-1963)
Third Generation Computers (1964-1971)
Fourth Generation Computers (1971-Present)
Fifth Generation Computers (Present and Beyond)

					Types of  Computer
				</header>
				<p>
					Depending upon the internal structure and subsequent features and applicability, computer system is categorized as follows âˆ’

<b>Mainframe Computer</b>
It is high capacity and costly computer. It is largely used by big organizations where many people can use it simultaneously.

<b>Super Computer</b>
This category of computer is the fastest and also very expensive. A typical supercomputer can solve up to ten trillion individual calculations per second.

<b>Workstation Computer</b>
The computer of this category is a high-end and expensive one. It is exclusively made for complex work purpose.Personal Computer (PC)
It is a low capacity computer developed for single users.

<b>Apple Macintosh (Mac)</b>
It is a sort of personal computer manufactured by Apple company.

<b>Laptop computer (notebook)</b>
It is a handy computer that can be easily carried anywhere.

					Usage of computer
				</header>

				<p>
					A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, 
                    or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data.
                     You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, 
                     send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create
                      spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos. 
                      Before we talk about different types of computers, let's talk about two things all computers have in common: hardware and software.

Hardware is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts, which you can see in the image below.
